This repository is for self-introduction.

I’m a Software Engineering student at Van Lang University with a strong passion for Data Engineering. Over the past 1.5 years, I’ve self-taught key data technologies including SQL, Python, ETL processes, and Database design, and applied them to personal projects.

Currently, I’m diving deeper into Big Data tools (Spark, Airflow) and cloud platforms (AWS/GCP) to build end-to-end data solutions. I’m eager to collaborate on real-world projects, contribute to open-source initiatives, and learn from industry experts.

My goal is to bridge the gap between academic knowledge and practical data engineering challenges—whether it’s optimizing queries, designing efficient pipelines, or ensuring data quality. Let’s connect if you share the same enthusiasm for data!
